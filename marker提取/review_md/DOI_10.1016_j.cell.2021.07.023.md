In brief
A study of nasopharyngeal swabs from
healthy and COVID-19-infected

SUMMARY
SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause severe respiratory COVID-19. However, many individuals present with iso-
lated upper respiratory symptoms, suggesting potential to constrain viral pathology to the nasopharynx.
Which cells SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets and how infection inﬂuences the respiratory epithelium remains
incompletely understood. We performed scRNA-seq on nasopharyngeal swabs from 58 healthy and
COVID-19 participants. During COVID-19, we observe expansion of secretory, loss of ciliated, and epithelial
cell repopulation via deuterosomal cell expansion. In mild and moderate COVID-19, epithelial cells express
anti-viral/interferon-responsive genes, while cells in severe COVID-19 have muted anti-viral responses
despite equivalent viral loads. SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ host-target cells are highly heterogenous, including devel-
oping ciliated, interferon-responsive ciliated, AZGP1high goblet, and KRT13+ ‘‘hillock’’-like cells, and we iden-
tify genes associated with susceptibility, resistance, or infection response. Our study deﬁnes protective and
detrimental responses to SARS-CoV-2, the direct viral targets of infection, and suggests that failed nasal
epithelial anti-viral immunity may underlie and precede severe COVID-19.
INTRODUCTION
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and
has led to one of the most devastating global pandemics in mod-
ern history. Similar to other successful respiratory viruses, high
replication within the nasopharynx (Pan et al., 2020; Sanche
et al., 2020) and viral shedding by asymptomatic or presymp-
tomatic individuals contributes to enhanced transmissibility
(Fears et al., 2020; Meyerowitz et al., 2021) and rapid community
spread (Arons et al., 2020; Sakurai et al., 2020; Wang et al.,
2020c). COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infec-
tion, occurs in a fraction of those infected and can carry profound
morbidity and mortality. The clinical pictures of COVID-19 vary
widely—from a few mild symptoms to prolonged and severe

disease characterized by pneumonia, acute respiratory distress
syndrome, and diverse systemic effects impacting various tis-
sues (Guan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020a). To facilitate effec-
tive prophylactics and therapeutics for COVID-19, differentiating
protective host mechanisms that support rapid viral clearance
and limit disease from those that drive severe and fatal outcomes
is essential.
SARS-CoV-2, like other respiratory coronaviruses, enters
through the mouth or nares and initially replicates within epithe-
lial cells of the human nasopharynx, generating an upper respira-
tory infection over several days (Frieman and Baric, 2008; Harri-
son et al., 2020). A subset of patients develop symptoms of lower
respiratory infection, where a combination of inﬂammatory im-
mune responses and direct viral-mediated pathogenesis can
lead to diffuse damage to distal airways, alveoli, and vasculature
(Ackermann et al., 2020; Borczuk et al., 2020). Reproducible
immune correlates of severe COVID-19 include prolonged
detection of proinﬂammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNFa,
and IL-8, diminished type I and type III interferon, and marked
lymphopenia, as well as mixed evidence for immune exhaustion
and dysfunctional myeloid populations (Galani et al., 2021; Had-
jadj et al., 2020; Kusnadi et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Lucas et al.,
2020; Mathew et al., 2020; Mudd et al., 2020; Schulte-Schrep-
ping et al., 2020; Stephenson et al., 2021; Su et al., 2020; Wilk
et al., 2020). Most reports have measured host responses in pe-
ripheral blood, which may only partially reﬂect immune status
within virally targeted tissues (Ren et al., 2021; Szabo et al.,
2020; Weisberg et al., 2021).
Central to understanding SARS-CoV-2-induced disease pa-
thology is identifying the direct cellular targets of infection within
human respiratory tissues. Multiple meta-analyses of single-cell
RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets have nominated puta-
tive SARS-CoV-2 targets within the oropharyngeal, nasal, and
upper airway tissues, including subsets of ciliated, secretory,
and goblet cells, and within the lung parenchyma, type II pneu-
mocytes (Huang et al., 2020b; Lukassen et al., 2020; Muus
et al., 2020; Sungnak et al., 2020; Ziegler et al., 2020). A study
jointly collecting nasopharyngeal (NP) and bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) samples from a cohort of COVID-19 patients iden-
tiﬁed rare SARS-CoV-2 RNA-containing cells assigned to cili-
ated and secretory cell types (Chua et al., 2020). Further work us-
ing human tissues at autopsy found infected ciliated cells lining
the trachea and distal lung airways (Hou et al., 2020; Schaefer
et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). However, the early targets for
SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharynx, the scope of potential host
cells, and the variance in viral tropism across patients and dis-
ease courses have yet to be deﬁned.
Compared to other common respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2
appears to elicit poor type I interferon (IFN) responses in cultured
human epithelial cells, and instead skews toward proinﬂamma-
tory cytokine proﬁles, in line with observations from human pe-
ripheral studies (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Galani et al., 2021;
Ravindra et al., 2021). Though animal models have offered crit-
ical insight into SARS-CoV-2 behavior in vivo, different models
vary widely in the severity of SARS-CoV-2-driven disease and
associated immunopathology, and incompletely reﬂect the di-
versity of viral infection outcomes and natural immune responses
in humans (Chandrashekar et al., 2020; Israelow et al., 2020;
Mun˜ oz-Fontela et al., 2020; Speranza et al., 2021). Work
leveraging human cohorts has identiﬁed an enrichment for
both inborn errors of type I IFN signaling and the presence of au-
toantibodies against type I IFNs among patients with severe
COVID-19, providing potential explanations for failed or insufﬁ-
cient anti-viral immunity within a subset of severe cases, and
further supporting the need for human cohort studies that repre-
sent the breadth of host-viral interactions (Bastard et al., 2020,
2021; Combes et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021a; van der Wijst
et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020).
Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the cellular phe-
notypes in the nasal mucosa during early SARS-CoV-2 infection.
To achieve this, we developed tissue-handling protocols that
enabled
high-quality
scRNA-seq
from
frozen
NP
swabs
collected from a large patient cohort (n = 58) at the early stages
of clinical presentation, and created a detailed map of epithelial
and immune cell diversity. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection
leads to a dramatic loss of mature ciliated cells, which is associ-
ated with secretory cell expansion, differentiation, and the
accumulation of deuterosomal cell intermediates—potentially
involved in the compensatory repopulation of damaged ciliated
epithelium. While we observe broad induction of IFN-responsive
and anti-viral genes in cells from individuals with mild or moder-
ate COVID-19, severe COVID-19 is characterized by a dramati-
cally blunted IFN response, and mucosal recruitment of highly in-
ﬂammatory myeloid populations, which represent the primary
sources of tissue pro-inﬂammatory cytokines including TNF,
IL1B, and CXCL8. Further, using unbiased whole-transcriptomic
ampliﬁcation, we map not only host cellular RNA, but also cell-
associated SARS-CoV-2 RNA, allowing us to trace viral tropism
to speciﬁc epithelial subsets and identify host pathways linked
with susceptibility or resistance to infection. Together, our data
suggest that an early failure of intrinsic anti-viral immunity among
nasal epithelial cells responding to SARS-CoV-2 infection may
underlie and predict progression to severe COVID-19.
RESULTS
Deﬁning cellular diversity in the human nasopharyngeal
mucosa
NP swabs were collected from 58 individuals from the University
of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) between April and
September 2020. This cohort consisted of 35 individuals who
had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR NP swab on the day of hospital
presentation. A control group consisted of 15 individuals who
were asymptomatic and had a negative SARS-CoV-2 NP PCR,
6 intubated individuals in the intensive care unit without a recent
history of COVID-19 and negative SARS-CoV-2 NP PCR, and 2
additional individuals with recent history of COVID-19 and nega-
tive SARS-CoV-2 NP PCR, classiﬁed as ‘‘convalescent’’ (Table
1, Figures S1A–S1H, see STAR Methods for full inclusion and
exclusion criteria). Using the World Health Organization (WHO)
guidelines for stratiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of COVID-19
severity, we grouped individuals with COVID-19 based on the
maximum (‘‘peak’’) level of required respiratory support (World
Health Organization, 2020). NP samples were obtained by a
trained healthcare provider and rapidly cryopreserved to main-
tain cellular viability (Figures 1A and S1I). Swabs were processed

to recover single-cell suspensions (mean ± SEM: 57,000 ±
15,000 total cells recovered per swab), before generating sin-
gle-cell transcriptomes using Seq-Well S3 (Gierahn et al., 2017;
Hughes et al., 2019).
Among all COVID-19 and control samples, we recovered
32,871 genes across 32,588 cells (following ﬁltering and quality
control) and annotated 18 clusters corresponding to distinct
cell types across immune and epithelial identities (Figures 1B–
1E and S1J–S1L, Table S1). We individually annotated clusters
based on several references (Deprez et al., 2020; Garcıa´ et al.,
2019; Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2018). Among epithelial cell
types, we identiﬁed basal cells by their expression of TP63,
KRT15, and KRT5, and mitotic basal cells using genes involved
in the cell cycle (MKI67, TOP2A) (Figure 1F). We resolved large
populations of secretory cells and goblet cells (KRT7, CXCL17,
F3, AQP5, CP); despite strong transcriptional similarity, we
distinguished between goblet and secretory cells based on
expression of MUC5AC-expressing goblet, and BPIFA1-ex-
pressing secretory cells. We also resolved a population of iono-
cytes (FOXI1, FOXI2, CFTR), a recently identiﬁed specialized
subtype of secretory cell involved in regulating mucus viscosity
within respiratory epithelia (Montoro et al., 2018; Plasschaert
et al., 2018). Squamous cells were identiﬁed by expression of
SCEL, as well as multiple SPRR genes, and potentially derive
from the squamous epithelium of the anterior nose or posterior
pharynx. Ciliated cells (FOXJ1 and a ciliogenesis gene program,
e.g., DLEC1, DNAH11, CFAP43) were the most numerous
epithelial cell type recovered. We also identiﬁed two populations
of precursor ciliated cells: one, termed ‘‘developing ciliated
cells,’’ expressed canonical ciliated cell genes such as FOXJ1,

CAPSL, and PIFO at lower levels than mature ciliated cells and
lacked expression of cilia-forming genes; we also resolved deu-
terosomal cells (DEUP1, CCNO, CDC20B, FOXN4, HES6)—a
ciliated cell precursor arising from secretory cell/goblet cell dif-
ferentiation (Garcıa´ et al., 2019). Among lymphoid cells, we
recovered T cells (CD3E, CD2, TRBC2) and B cells (MS4A1,
CD79A, CD79B). Among myeloid cell types, we recovered a
large population of macrophages (CD14, FCGR3A, VCAN), den-
dritic cells (CCR7, CD86), and plasmacytoid DCs (IRF7, IL3RA).
Relative to true tissue-resident abundances, we under-recov-
ered granulocytes, likely due to the intrinsic fragility of these
cell types and the cryopreservation required in our sample pipe-
line (Figures S2A–S2G). We recovered a small population of mast
cells (GATA2, TPSB2, PTGS2) (Dwyer et al., 2021). Each cell type
is represented by cells from numerous participants. From each
participant, we recovered a diversity of cell types and states,
though the cellular composition is highly variable between
distinct individuals (Figures 1G and 1H).
We interrogated each cell type for the expression of host fac-
tors utilized by common respiratory viruses to facilitate cellular
entry (Figure 1I; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Li et al., 2003; Sungnak
et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b; Wrapp et al., 2020; Yan et al.,
2020). We ﬁnd ACE2 expression highest among secretory cells
and goblet cells, and to a lesser extent in ciliated cells, devel-
oping ciliated cells, deuterosomal cells, and squamous cells—
suggesting that these cells are likely targets for SARS-CoV-2
(and other betacoronaviruses that use ACE2 as their primary
cellular entry factor). SARS-CoV-2 spike protein requires ‘‘prim-
ing’’ by host proteases such as TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, CTSL,
and FURIN for effective cell entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020).
TMPRSS2, likely the principal host factor for SARS-CoV-2 S
cleavage, is found in highest abundance in squamous cells, fol-
lowed by modest expression in all other epithelial cell types.
Similarly, CTSL (and other cathepsins) is found across diverse
epithelial and myeloid cell types.
To assess compositional differences by disease severity, we
grouped SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative par-
ticipants by their peak level of respiratory support according to
the WHO scoring system: control WHO 0 (comprising healthy
SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative participants, n = 15), control WHO
7–8 (SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative, intubated participants treated
in the ICU for non-COVID-19 diagnoses, n = 6), COVID-19 WHO
1–5 (SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive, mild/moderate disease, n = 14),
and COVID-19 WHO 6–8 (SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive, severe
disease, n = 21) (Figures 1J–1N). The abundance of ciliated cells
is signiﬁcantly reduced among COVID-19 WHO 6–8 participants
compared to healthy controls (Figure 1J) and developing ciliated
cells are signiﬁcantly increased (Figure 1K). Likewise, deuteroso-
mal cells are signiﬁcantly increased among samples obtained
from control WHO 7–8, COVID-19 WHO 1–5, and COVID-19
WHO 6–8 samples (Figure 1L). The percentage of secretory cells
is also increased among all COVID-19 participants compared to
both the WHO 0 and WHO 7–8 control groups (Figure 1M). We
conﬁrmed expansion of secretory cells during severe COVID-
19 by ﬂow cytometry in a separate cohort of control WHO
0 (n = 7) and COVID-19 WHO 6–8 (n = 7) participants (Figures
S2H and S2I; STAR Methods). Expansion of secretory cells
and loss of ciliated cells results in a net gain in epithelial diversity
(Figure 1O).
Epithelial diversity and remodeling after SARS-CoV-2
infection
Next, we sought to more completely delineate the diversity of
epithelial cells through iterative clustering and sub-clustering
(see STAR Methods, Figures 2A–2E and S2J, Table S1). We
examined epithelial subtypes for their expression of host entry
factors which facilitate viral entry among common upper respira-
tory pathogens (Figure S2K). Among goblet cells, AZGP1high
goblet cells express the highest abundance of ACE2 mRNA,
suggesting this cell type may be a preferential target for SARS-
CoV-2. Likewise, early response secretory cells, KRT24highKR-
T13high secretory cells, and interferon responsive secretory cells
all express elevated abundances of ACE2. To map the differen-
tiation and inter-relationships between epithelial cell types, we
applied single-cell RNA velocity (scVelo), which leverages RNA
splicing dynamics to infer developmental trajectories (STAR
Methods; Bergen et al., 2020; La Manno et al., 2018). Globally,
RNA velocity appropriately places basal cells and mitotic basal
cells as the ‘‘root’’ of cellular transitions, which then progresses
through developing secretory and goblet cells to secretory and
goblet cells. Developing ciliated cells and ciliated cells are
placed ‘‘later’’ in the differentiation trajectory, distal to develop-
ment of both secretory and deuterosomal cells, consistent with
current models where ciliated cells represent a terminally differ-
entiated state and may arise from these precursor cell types
(Garcıa´ et al., 2019). Together, this analysis enables us to map
the developmental relationships between major epithelial cell
compartments and connect the loss of ‘‘terminally differenti-
ated’’ or ‘‘mature’’ cell types in COVID-19, e.g., ciliated cells,
with the concurrent expansion of their precursors: secretory,
deuterosomal, and developing ciliated cells (Figure S2L).
We next analyzed developmental transitions among detailed
epithelial cell subtypes. When considering only basal, goblet,
and secretory cell subtypes, we found LGR5, TP63, EGFR, and
KRT5 expression gradually decline across basal and developing
secretory and goblet cells, while expression of secretory and
goblet cell-speciﬁc markers (KRT7, AQP5) progressively in-
crease (Figures 2F–2I). The majority of secretory and goblet
clusters
are

positive SARS-CoV-2 PCRs, with signiﬁcant expansion of SER-

cell types, consistent with the current understanding of respira-
tory secretory cell plasticity (Tata et al., 2013).
Ciliated cell subtypes were also analyzed via RNA velocity and
pseudotemporal ordering (Figures 2K–2N). The velocity pseudo-
time predicts progression from developing ciliated cells to
FOXJ1high ciliated cells, to BEST4highciliahigh ciliated cells, and
terminating in ciliahigh ciliated cells (Figure 2M). IFN-responsive
ciliated cells and early response FOXJ1high ciliated cells repre-
sent phenotypic deviations from this ordered progression, and
therefore appear collapsed/unresolved along this trajectory
with the same pseudotime range as FOXJ1high ciliated cells.
Among COVID-19 participants, we observe decreased propor-
tions of both ciliahigh and BEST4highciliahigh ciliated cells, two
subsets which represent the most terminally differentiated cili-
ated cell subtypes (Figure 2O). This effect is particularly pro-
nounced among individuals with severe disease, suggesting
that the overall reduction in upper airway ciliated cells during
COVID-19 preferentially affects terminally differentiated subsets,
potentially due to delayed replenishing from secretory/deutero-
somal precursors or enhanced susceptibility to viral-mediated
pathogenesis.
Among
individuals
with
mild
or
moderate
COVID-19, we ﬁnd an increase in the proportion of interferon-
responsive ciliated cells—averaging 15.9% of all epithelial cells
among mild and moderate COVID-19 participants—compared
to <1% among healthy controls.
Finally, we directly mapped the developmental transitions
among nasal epithelial cells within control (Figure 2P) or
COVID-19 participants only (Figure 2Q). Cells from control par-
ticipants poorly populated the intermediate regions that bridge
secretory and goblet cell types to mature ciliated cells (Yoshida
et al., 2021). Conversely, regions annotated as multiple secretory
cell subsets and developing ciliated cells are uniquely captured
from COVID-19 participants. Together, our analysis deﬁnes the
diversity among cells collected from NP swabs, as well as the
nuanced developmental relationships between epithelial cells
of the upper airway.
Alterations to nasal mucosal immune populations in
COVID-19
As with epithelial cells, we further clustered and annotated
detailed immune cell populations (Figure S3, Table S1). Among
immune cells, macrophages markedly increase in abundance
during severe COVID-19 (Figures S3G and S3H). Multiple
specialized myeloid cell types are uniquely detected and en-
riched among COVID-19 participants, albeit in a subset of partic-
ipants, and biased to severe COVID-19 cases: ITGAXhigh macro-
phages, FFAR4high macrophages, inﬂammatory macrophages,
and IFN-responsive macrophages (Figure S3H). Rare plasmacy-
toid DCs and mast cells are recovered as >1% of immune cells
only among COVID-19 participants. Finally, we assessed the
correlation between distinct immune cell types across all partic-
ipants. The proportional abundance of dendritic cells, mast cells,
and macrophages are highly correlated with one another (p <
0.01), likely indicative of coordinated recruitment during inﬂam-
mation. IFN-responsive macrophages are correlated with IFN-
responsive cytotoxic CD8 T cells (p < 0.01, Figure S3I), suggest-
ing potential direct communication between IFNG-expressing
tissue-resident T cells and CXCL9/10/11-expressing myeloid
cells. Collectively, the epithelial and immune compartments are
dramatically altered during COVID-19, likely reﬂecting both pro-
tective anti-viral and regenerative responses, as well as patho-
logic changes underlying progression to severe disease.
Cell states associated with COVID-19 severity
Next, we examined how each cell type responds according to
different peak disease severity scores. We performed pairwise
differential expression (DE) tests between control WHO 0,
COVID-19 WHO 1–5, and COVID-19 WHO 6–8 groups (Tables
S2, S3, and S4). Among all coarse cell types, the largest tran-
scriptional changes (measured by the number of DE genes
with FDR < 0.001, and log fold change > 0.25) are observed
within the epithelial compartment, including ciliated cells, devel-
oping ciliated cells, secretory cells, goblet cells, and ionocytes
(Figure S4A). Among detailed cell types, we observed the
largest transcriptional changes among AZGP1high goblet cells,
early-response FOXJ1high ciliated cells, FOXJ1high ciliated cells,
MUC5AChigh
goblet
cells,
SERPINB11high
secretory
cells,
early-response secretory cells, and IFN-responsive ciliated cells
(Figure 3A). When we directly compared mild or moderate to se-
vere COVID-19, we found that multiple cell types show robust
transcriptional changes, most drastically among ciliated cell
subtypes (IFN-responsive ciliated cells, FOXJ1high ciliated cells,
early-response FOXJ1high ciliated cells, developing ciliated
cells), ionocytes, SERPINB11high secretory cells, early-response
secretory cells, and AZGP1high goblet cells.
Compared to ciliated cells from control WHO 0 participants,
cells from both mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 upregulated
genes involved in the host response to virus, including IFI27,
IFIT1, IFI6, IFITM3, and GBP3, and both groups induce expres-
sion of MHC-I and MHC-II genes (HLA-A, HLA-C, HLA-F, HLA-
E, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRA) and other factors involved in antigen
processing and presentation (Figures 3B and S4B). Large sets
of IFN-responsive and anti-viral genes are exclusively induced
among ciliated cells from COVID-19 WHO 1–5 participants
when compared to control WHO 0 participants. In a direct com-
parison of ciliated cells from mild or moderate to severe
COVID-19, the cells from individuals with mild or moderate dis-
ease show strong upregulation of diverse anti-viral factors,
including IFI44L, STAT1, IFITM1, MX1, IFITM3, OAS1, OAS2,
OAS3, STAT2, TAP1, HLA-C, ADAR, XAF1, IRF1, CTSS, CTSB,
and many others. Ciliated cells from severe COVID-19 uniquely
upregulate IL5RA and NLRP1. Together, these DE gene sets

suggest exposure to secreted inﬂammatory factors and type I/II/
III IFNs, as well as direct cellular sensing of viral products. Using
previously published data from human nasal basal cells treated
in vitro with either type I (IFNa) or type II (IFNg) IFNs (Ziegler
et al., 2020), we created gene sets that represent the ‘‘shared’’
gene responses to type I and type II IFNs, and the cellular re-
sponses speciﬁc to either type (Figure 3B). Using gene set enrich-
ment analysis (GSEA), we tested whether the genes that discrim-
inate ciliated cells from different groups (e.g., mild or moderate
versus severe COVID-19) imply exposure to speciﬁc IFN types.
We found that ciliated cells in mild or moderate COVID-19
robustly induce type I IFN-speciﬁc gene signatures, both
compared to cells from healthy controls as well as from severe
COVID-19. Further, when compared to cells from healthy individ-
uals, ciliated cells from individuals with severe COVID-19 did not
signiﬁcantly induce type I or type II IFN-responsive genes, poten-
tially underlying poor control of viral spread.
We next investigated whether these effects were observed
among other cell types and subsets. Surprisingly, even among
cells deﬁned as ‘‘IFN-responsive’’ ciliated cells, cells from mild
or moderate COVID-19 participants express higher fold changes
of IFN-responsive genes compared to cells from severe COVID-
19 participants or healthy controls (Figures 3C and 3D). Other
epithelial and immune cell types display a similar pattern: broad
IFN-responsive genes (largely type I speciﬁc) are strongly upre-
gulated among cells from mild or moderate COVID-19 partici-
pants, while cells from severe COVID-19 participants upregulate
few shared markers with mild or moderate COVID-19 partici-
pants, and instead skew toward inﬂammatory genes (S100A8,
S100A9) (Figures 3E–3H, S3J–S3L, and 4C). In some cases, cells
from individuals with severe COVID-19 express levels of IFN-
responsive or anti-viral genes indistinguishable from healthy
controls. Further, the absence of a transcriptional response to
secreted IFN cannot be explained by a lack of either IFNa-recep-
tor (IFNAR1, IFNAR2) or IFNg-receptor (IFNGR1, IFNGR2)
expression. Previous work has identiﬁed ACE2 as among the
IFN-induced genes in nasal epithelial cells, with uncertain signif-
icance for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Blume et al., 2021; Ng et al.,
2020; Onabajo et al., 2020; Ziegler et al., 2020). Indeed, we
ﬁnd modest upregulation of this gene among cells from
COVID-19 participants compared to healthy controls. Further,
some of the cell subtypes identiﬁed as expanded during
COVID-19 (e.g., IFN-responsive ciliated cells, BPIFA1high secre-
tory
cells,
BPIFA1highchemokinehigh
secretory
cells,
and
KRT24highKRT13high secretory cells) express relatively high
abundances of ACE2 (Figure S4D).
A proportion of COVID-19 participants in our study were
concurrently treated with corticosteroids, which mediate broad
anti-inﬂammatory and immunosuppressive effects. For some
genes, corticosteroid treatment is associated with a partially
suppressed IFN response within each group—for instance, cili-
ated cells from untreated COVID-19 WHO 1–5 participants
show higher abundances of IFITM1, OAS2, IFI6, and IFI27 than
their corticosteroid-treated counterparts—while still maintaining
strong differences in expression between severity groups (Fig-
ures S4E and S4F). Interestingly, induction of FKBP5 expression
among ciliated cells from severe COVID-19 participants is fully
explained by corticosteroid treatment, consistent with the role
for this protein in modulating glucocorticoid receptor activity.
The majority of anti-viral genes were not impacted by corticoste-
roid treatment, including STAT1, STAT2, IFI44, and ISG15 (Liu
et al., 2021). Together, these data demonstrate global blunting
of the anti-viral/IFN response among nasopharyngeal epithelial
cells during severe COVID-19.
We next attempted to query the source of local IFN. Many tis-
sue-resident immune cells reside principally within the deeper
lamina propria and submucosal spaces, and are therefore, as
expected, poorly represented in our dataset due to our sampling

strategy (swabbing of surface epithelial cells) (Deprez et al.,
2020; Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2018). Accordingly, we ﬁnd
few immune cell types producing IFNs: IFNA and IFNB are ab-
sent, rare IFNL1 reads are observed among T cells and macro-
phages, and IFNG is robustly produced from IFN-responsive
cytotoxic CD8 T cells (Figure S4G). We could not detect expres-
sion of any IFN types among epithelial cells, which differs
dramatically from previous observations of robust type I/III IFN
expression among nasal ciliated cells during inﬂuenza A and B
infection (also captured via Seq-Well S3; Cao et al., 2020) (Fig-
ure S4H). Rather, we observe robust induction of other inﬂam-
matory molecules from immune and epithelial cell types.

macrophages and IFN-responsive macrophages represent the
primary sources of local TNF, IL6, and IL10, and uniquely ex-
press high abundances of chemoattractant molecules such as
CCL3, CCL2, and CXCL8. Interestingly, IFN-responsive macro-
phages appear to be a principal source of CXCL9, CXCL10,
and CXCL11 (Figure S4G).
We directly tested whether the lack of an IFN-stimulated
response among nasal epithelial cells in severe COVID-19 partic-
ipants could be explained by autoantibody-mediated inhibition
of secreted interferons as reported in other cohorts (Bastard
et al., 2020, 2021; Wang et al., 2021a). Using matched plasma
collected at the time of NP swab, we analyzed a subset of 25 par-
ticipants for IgG and IgM antibodies targeting a large panel of po-
tential antigens (using a microarray-based antibody hybridiza-
tion platform; see STAR Methods). Here we found evidence for
IgG autoantibodies targeting IFN-u and 11 IFNa subtypes in 1/
8 participants who developed severe COVID-19, 0/12 partici-
pants with mild or moderate disease, and 0/5 healthy donors
(Figure 3I). We caution against generalizing this result due to
our limited cohort size; we note, however, that our ﬁndings agree
well with the expected proportion (10%) of severe individuals
with autoantibodies to IFN components from published data
(Bastard et al., 2020).
To better understand participant-to-participant variability in
anti-viral and IFN-responsive gene signatures, we analyzed the
average expression of STAT1, STAT2, IRF1, and IRF9—key tran-
scription factors responsible for the induction of IFN-stimulated
gene expression and IFN-induced genes themselves—among
ciliated cells from each participant (Figure 3J). We found that
the expression of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF1 was indistinguishable
among cells from control WHO 0, control WHO 7–8, and COVID-
19 WHO 6–8 participants. IRF9 was diminished among COVID-
19 WHO 6–8 participants and control WHO 7–8 participants
compared to healthy donors and participants with mild or mod-
erate COVID-19. Intriguingly, despite the absence of autoanti-
bodies directed at type I interferons, nearly all participants who
developed severe COVID-19 failed to induce STAT1, STAT2,
IRF1, and IRF9 expression (among other IFN-stimulated genes).
Even individuals who had milder disease and limited requirement
for respiratory support at the time of nasal swab, but later went
on to develop severe or fatal COVID-19 (swab WHO 1–5, peak
WHO 6–8), already had diminished STAT1 expression at the
time of nasal swab (Figure 3J). This suggests a potential predic-
tive value of poor interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) induction.
Co-detection of viral and host RNA and correlates of
nasal viral load
We next tested whether the observed epithelial and immune
phenotypes were associated with altered local viral abundance.
To perform an unbiased search for co-detected viral, bacterial,
and fungal genomic material, we used metatranscriptomic clas-
siﬁcation to assign reads according to a comprehensive refer-
ence database (previously described, see STAR Methods, Le-
mieux et al., 2021; Wood et al., 2019). As expected, the
majority (28/38) of swabs from individuals with COVID-19
contain reads classiﬁed as SARS coronavirus species (Figures
4A and S5A–S5C). Among samples containing SARS coronavi-
rus genomic material, the read abundance ranged from 2e0 to
8.8e6 reads (1.8e3 to 1.9e4 reads/million [M] total reads). We
found little evidence for co-occurring respiratory viruses.
Next, we analyzed all SARS-CoV-2-aligned unique molecular
identiﬁers (UMIs) following alignment to a joint genome contain-
ing both human and SARS-CoV-2 (Kim et al., 2020). We took the
sum of all SARS-CoV-2 aligning UMIs from a given participant—
both associated with high-complexity single-cell transcriptomes
and ambient RNA—as a representative measure of the total
SARS-CoV-2 burden within the tissue microenvironment. As
observed using metatranscriptomic classiﬁcation, we found
relatively low/spurious alignments to SARS-CoV-2 among con-
trol participants, while swabs from COVID-19 participants con-
tained a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 reads (Figures 4B, 4C,
S5D, and S5E). SARS-CoV-2 UMIs were detected in 80% (28/
35) of COVID-19 participants. Samples from participants who
developed severe COVID-19 contained signiﬁcantly higher
abundances of SARS-CoV-2 aligning UMIs than both control
groups, with an average of 1.1e2 ± 2.8e0 (geometric mean ±
SEM) UMIs per million (M) aligned UMIs (ranging from 0 to
1.5e5 per sample); swabs from participants with mild or moder-
ate COVID-19 contained slightly fewer SARS-CoV-2 aligning
UMIs, with an average of 1.1e1 ± 4.3e0 UMIs per M. Among all
cell types, we observe that secretory cells are signiﬁcantly posi-
tively correlated with the total viral abundance (Spearman’s rho =
0.49, Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.0015), while FOXJ1high ciliated
cells are negatively correlated (Spearman’s rho = 0.43, Bonfer-
roni-corrected p = 0.020, Figures 4D and 4E). We binned the
samples from COVID-19 participants into ‘‘viral low’’ and ‘‘viral
high’’ groupings (based on an arbitrary cutoff of 1e3 SARS-
CoV-2 UMIs per M; robust to a range of partition choices, Figures
S5E and S5F). IFN-responsive ciliated cells are expanded
among ‘‘viral high’’ COVID-19 samples, and plasmacytoid DCs
are only found in ‘‘viral low’’ samples. Finally, in a subset of pa-
tients for whom we obtained matched plasma samples on the
same day of NP swab (n = 36), we observe SARS-CoV-2 UMI
abundance is inversely correlated with the SARS-CoV-2 IgM
and IgG titers (Figure S5G). As severe COVID-19 has been
shown to correlate with higher antibody titers, this suggests
that several individuals in our cohort are sampled early in their
disease
trajectory,
though
we
note
there
is
substantial
complexity in interpreting how antibody levels align with the
timing of infection, viral load, and ISGs (Garcia-Beltran et al.,
2021; Long et al., 2020; Zohar et al., 2020).
Cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the
nasopharynx
Next, we aimed to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 UMIs derived from
ambient or low-complexity cell barcodes from those likely re-
ﬂecting intracellular RNA molecules within high-complexity sin-
gle-cell transcriptomes (Cao et al., 2020; Delorey et al., 2021;
Fleming et al., 2019; Kotliar et al., 2020). We ﬁltered to viral
UMIs associated with cells presented in Figure 1, removing
those associated with low-complexity or ambient-only cell
barcodes (Figure S5H). Next, we estimated the proportion of
ambient RNA contamination per single cell and the abundance
of SARS-CoV-2 RNA within the extracellular/ambient environ-
ment (i.e., not cell-associated) per sample. Using these parame-
ters, we tested whether the amount of viral RNA associated with

a given single-cell transcriptome was signiﬁcantly higher than
expected from ambient spillover. This enabled us to identify
cell barcodes whose SARS-CoV-2-aligning UMIs were likely
driven by spurious contamination, and annotate single cells
that contain probable cell-associated or intracellular SARS-
CoV-2 RNA (Figures 4C and S5H). Across all single cells, we
recover 415 high-conﬁdence SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells across
21 participants, which we conﬁrmed is not driven by technical
factors (Figure S5I). 262 SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells are from partic-
ipants who developed severe COVID-19 and 150 from mild or
moderate COVID-19. We detect three SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells
from participants with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR: two from a
participant identiﬁed as ‘‘COVID-19 convalescent,’’ and one
from a control participant. Among participants with any SARS-
CoV-2 RNA+ cells, we detect 20 ± 7 (mean ± SEM) SARS-CoV-
2 RNA+ cells per sample (range 1–119), amounting to 4% ±
1.3% (range 0.1%–24%) of the total recovered cells per sample
(Figure S5J). Within a given single cell, the abundance of SARS-
CoV-2 UMIs ranges from 1 to 12,612, corresponding to 0.01%–
98% of all human and viral UMIs per cell.
To further understand the biological signiﬁcance of SARS-
CoV-2-aligning UMIs within a single cell, and to better identify
cells with the highest likelihood of actively supporting viral repli-
cation, we analyzed the speciﬁc viral sequences and their align-
ment regions in the viral genome (Figures 4F, 4G, and S6A; Fung
and Liu, 2019; Hu et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2020). Single cells con-
taining higher abundances of spliced transcriptional regulatory
sequences (TRSs) or negative strand aligning reads are more
likely to represent truly virally infected cells with a functional viral
replication and transcription complex. We integrate these and
other aspects of the host and viral transcriptomes to reﬁne and
contextualize our conﬁdence in ‘‘SARS-CoV-2 RNA+’’ cells. Crit-
ically, the co-detection of host transcriptomic and viral genomic
material associated with a single cell barcode cannot deﬁnitively
establish the presence of intracellular virus and/or productive
infection. The majority of SARS-CoV-2-aligning UMIs among
SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells are found heavily biased toward the
30 end of the genome, attributed to the 30 UTR, ORF10, and N
gene regions, as expected due to poly(A) priming (Figure 4H).
A majority (68.7%) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells contain reads
aligning to the viral negative strand, increasing the likelihood
that many of these cells represent true targets of SARS-CoV-2
virions in vivo. In addition to negative strand alignment, we ﬁnd
roughly 1/4 of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells contain at least
100 UMIs that map to more than 20 distinct viral genomic loca-
tions per cell. When comparing spliced to unspliced UMIs, we
ﬁnd a minor fraction of cells with reads mapping directly across
a spliced TRS sequence (4.6%), while 35% of SARS-CoV-2
RNA+ cells contain reads mapping across the equivalent 70-
mer window around an unspliced TRS.
Next, we integrated (1) the strand and splice information
among SARS-CoV-2-aligning UMIs, (2) participant-to-partici-
pant diversity, and (3) cell type annotations to gain a comprehen-
sive picture of the identity and range of SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells
within the nasopharyngeal mucosa (Figures 5A–5D and S6A–
S6E). The majority of SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells are ciliated,
goblet, secretory, or squamous. Highest-conﬁdence SARS-
CoV-2 RNA+ cells (containing UMIs aligning across a spliced
TRS, negative-strand UMIs, and >100 SARS-CoV-2 UMIs/cell)
tended to be found among MUC5AChigh goblet cells, AZGP1high
goblet cells, BPIFA1high secretory cells, KRT24highKRT13high
secretory cells, CCL5high squamous cells, developing ciliated
cells, and each ciliated cell subtype. A high proportion of IFN-
responsive macrophages contained SARS-CoV-2 genomic ma-
terial, and rare ITGAXhigh macrophages are found to contain
UMIs aligning to viral negative strand or spliced TRS regions—
likely representing myeloid cells that have recently engulfed vir-
ally infected epithelial cells or free virions. We did not ﬁnd major
differences in the presumptive cellular tropism by peak COVID-
19 severity. The cell types harboring the highest proportions of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells represent the same cell types uniquely
expanded or induced within COVID-19 participants, such as
KRT24highKRT13high secretory cells, AZGP1high goblet cells,
and IFN-responsive ciliated cells, and contain the highest abun-
dances of ACE2-expressing cells (Figure 5E). Developing ciliated
cells contain among the highest SARS-CoV-2 RNA molecules
per cell, including positive strand, negative strand-aligning
reads, and spliced TRS reads (Figure S6F). Among ciliated cell
subtypes, IFN-responsive ciliated cells, despite representing
one of the most frequent ‘‘targets’’ of viral infection, contain
the lowest per-cell abundances of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, potentially
reﬂecting the impact of elevated anti-viral factors curbing high
levels of intracellular viral replication (Figure S6G).
Cell-intrinsic responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection
We next mapped both the cell-intrinsic response to direct viral
infection as well as the host cell identities that may potentiate
or enable SARS-CoV-2 tropism and replication. To control for
variability among different SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cell types and in-
dividuals, we compared SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells to bystander
cells of the same cell type and participant (Figures 6A). Many
of the genes previously identiﬁed as increased within all cells
from COVID-19 participants, e.g., anti-viral factors IFITM3,
MX1, IFI44L, and IRF1, are upregulated among SARS-CoV-2
RNA+ cells compared to matched bystanders. The majority of
genes induced within SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells are shared across
diverse cell types, suggesting a conserved anti-viral response
and common features that facilitate or restrict infection (Figures
6B–6D, Table S5). SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells expressed signiﬁ-
cantly higher abundances of multiple proteases involved in the
cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a required step for viral
entry (TMPRSS4, TMPRSS2, CTSS, CTSD). This suggests that
within a given cell type, natural variations in the abundance of
genes which support the viral life cycle may partially account
for which cells are successfully targeted by the virus.
Among the core anti-viral/IFN-responsive gene sets induced
within SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells, we observed repeated and
robust upregulation of IFITM3 and IFITM1. Multiple studies
have demonstrated that while these two IFN-inducible factors
can disrupt viral release from endocytic compartments among
a wide diversity of viral species, IFITMs can instead facilitate en-
try by human betacoronaviruses (Fung and Liu, 2019; Zhao et al.,
2014). Therefore, enrichment of these factors within presumptive
infected cells may reﬂect viral hijacking of a conserved host anti-
viral responsive pathway. Genes involved in cholesterol and lipid
biosynthesis are also upregulated among SARS-CoV-2 RNA+

enzymes involved in the mevalonate synthesis pathway. In addi-
tion, SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells show increased abundance of
low-density lipoprotein receptors LDLR and LRP8 compared to
matched bystanders. Various genes involved in cholesterol
metabolism were recently identiﬁed as critical host factors for
SARS-CoV-2 replication via CRISPR screens, and additional
hits from these datasets are similarly enriched among SARS-
CoV-2 RNA+ cells in our study (Figure S7A; Daniloski et al.,
2021; Schneider et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021b; Wei et al.,
2021). We found increased expression of S100/Calbindin genes
such as S100A6, S100A4, and S100A9 among SARS-CoV-2

RNA+ cells, which may directly play a role in leukocyte recruit-
ment to infected cells. Finally, we found multiple genes impli-
cated in susceptibility and response to SARS-CoV-2 infection
which have not been previously described. IFNAR1 was sub-
stantially increased in many bystander cells compared to both
cells from control participants as well as matched SARS-CoV-
2 RNA+ cells (Figure 6D). Blunting of IFNa signaling via downre-
gulation of IFNAR1 within SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells may partially
explain high levels of viral replication compared to neighboring
cells. Finally, bystander cells expressed signiﬁcantly higher
abundances of MHC-II molecules compared to SARS-CoV-2
RNA+ cells, including HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB5,
HLA-DRA, and CD74.
Anti-viral factors were largely absent from presumptive virally
infected cells in participants who developed severe COVID-19,
despite equivalent abundances of cell-associated viral UMIs
and elevated UMIs/cell aligning to the viral negative strand (Fig-
ures 6E and S7B). EIF2AK2, which encodes protein kinase R and
drives host cell apoptosis following recognition of intracellular
double-stranded RNA, is among the most reliably expressed
and
upregulated
genes
among
SARS-CoV-2
RNA+
cells
compared to matched bystanders across diverse cell types,
suggesting rapid activation of this gene following intrinsic
PAMP recognition of SARS-CoV-2 replication intermediates
(Kra¨ hling et al., 2009). Neither EIF2AK2 nor IFN-responsive tran-
scription factors such as STAT1 and STAT2 were expressed
within SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells from participants who developed
severe COVID-19 (Figure 6E). This suggests that direct sensing
of intracellular viral products may amplify IFN-responsive and
anti-viral gene upregulation, though these pathways are only
induced among SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells from participants with
mild or moderate COVID-19 (Figure 6F). Together, this suggests
a failure of the intrinsic immune response to viral infection among
nasal
epithelial
cells
in
individuals
who
develop
severe
COVID-19.
DISCUSSION
We present a comprehensive map of SARS-CoV-2 infection of
the human nasopharynx using scRNA-seq. We hypothesize
that the host response at the site of initial infection, the nasal mu-
cosa, is an essential determinant of overall COVID-19 disease
trajectory. By dissecting the nature of host-pathogen interac-
tions at this primary viral target across the spectrum of disease
trajectories, we characterize both protective and pathogenic re-
sponses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This enables us to begin to
untangle the myriad factors that may restrict viral infection to
the upper respiratory tract or support the development of severe
lower respiratory tract disease (Figure S7C). Our study deﬁnes
major compositional differences in the nasal epithelia during
COVID-19 and directly relates these to NP viral load, cellular
tropism, and cell-intrinsic responses to SARS-CoV-2. Further,
we identify marked variability in the induction of anti-viral gene
expression that is associated with peak disease severity and
may precede development of severe respiratory damage. We
ﬁnd that anti-viral gene expression is profoundly blunted in cells
isolated from individuals who develop severe disease, even in
cells containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Individuals who develop severe COVID-19 have equivalent or
even elevated levels of nasal SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the time of
sampling and contained expanded inﬂammatory and type II-
IFN-responsive macrophages compared to mild or moderate
cases. Indeed, published peripheral immune studies comparing
mild and severe COVID-19 also observe diminished type I and
type III IFN abundances in severe cases and note restricted
IFN-stimulated gene expression among circulating immune cells
(Galani et al., 2021; Hadjadj et al., 2020; Stephenson et al., 2021).
Other human betacoronaviruses (MERS and SARS-CoV) exhibit
multiple strategies to avoid triggering pattern recognition recep-
tor pathways, including degradation of host mRNA within in-
fected cells (Kamitani et al., 2009; Lokugamage et al., 2015),
sequestration of viral replication intermediates (e.g., double
stranded RNA) from host sensors (Knoops et al., 2008), and
direct inhibition of immune effector molecules (Fung and Liu,
2019; Kra¨ hling et al., 2009; Menachery et al., 2014), leading to
diminished induction of anti-viral pathways and blunted auto-
crine and paracrine IFN signaling. Strategies to avoid innate im-
mune recognition have now been extended to SARS-CoV-2 as
well, indicating that avoiding host recognition is likely an essen-
tial aspect of viral success (Banerjee et al., 2020; Konno et al.,
2020; Snijder et al., 2020). The close association we observe be-
tween peak disease severity and weak anti-viral gene expression
among nasal epithelial cells is intriguing given recent observa-
tions of inborn defects in TLR3, IRF7, IRF9, and IFNAR1, or anti-
body-mediated neutralization of type I IFN responses within indi-
viduals who develop severe COVID-19 (Bastard et al., 2020,
2021; Combes et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021a; Zhang et al.,
2020). Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that severe infec-
tion arises in the setting of impaired intrinsic epithelial anti-viral
immunity, even in the absence of detectable type I IFN-targeting
autoantibodies. We surmise that the combined effects of a viral
strain with naturally poor IFN induction and defects in immune
or intrinsic epithelial anti-viral responses within the nasal mucosa
may predispose to severe disease via enhanced viral replication
in the upper airway, eventually leading to immunopathology
characteristic of severe COVID-19.
Among individuals who develop severe COVID-19 in our
cohort, we observe unique recruitment of highly inﬂammatory
macrophages that represent the major tissue sources of proin-
ﬂammatory cytokines including IL1B, TNF, CXCL8, CCL2,
CCL3, and CXCL9/10/11—of likely relation to the immune dysre-
gulation characterized by elevation of the same factors in the pe-
riphery in severe disease and observed in lung tissue among
those who succumbed to COVID-19 (Delorey et al., 2021; Lucas
et al., 2020). In addition, we note speciﬁc upregulation of alar-
mins S100A8/S100A9 (i.e., calprotectin) among epithelial cells
in the severe COVID-19 group compared to mild or moderate
and control counterparts, and even higher expression of
S100A9 within SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells from those same individ-
uals. A recent study identiﬁed these as potential biomarkers of
severe COVID-19 and proposed that these factors directly drive
excessive inﬂammation and precede the massive cytokine
release characteristic of late disease (Silvin et al., 2020). Our
work suggests that severe COVID-19-speciﬁc expression of cal-
protectin may originate within the virally infected nasal epithelia.

S100A8/A9 gene expression may help clarify maladaptive re-
sponses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Finally, we provide a direct investigation into the host factors
that enable or restrict SARS-CoV-2 replication within epithelial
cells in vivo. We recapitulate expected ‘‘hits’’ based on well-
described
host
factors
involved
in
viral
replication—e.g.,
TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 enrichment among presumptive virally
infected cells. In accordance with previous studies into the nasal
epithelial response to inﬂuenza infection (Cao et al., 2020), we
observe bystander epithelial cell upregulation of both MHC-I
and MHC-II family genes; however, we ﬁnd that SARS-CoV-2
RNA+ cells only express MHC-I, and poorly express MHC-II
genes compared to matched bystanders. To our knowledge,
downregulation of host cell pathways for antigen presentation
by coronaviruses has not been previously described. A recent
study found that CIITA and CD74 can intrinsically block entry
of a range of viruses (including SARS-CoV-2) via endosomal
sequestration, and therefore cells that upregulate these (and
other) components of MHC-II machinery may naturally restrict
viral entry (Bruchez et al., 2020).
Together, our work and that of our colleagues suggest that
several mechanisms that restrict interferon-mediated viral con-
trol in the upper respiratory epithelium can enable progression
to severe COVID-19, that these causes may be multifactorial
and rooted in human diversity, and yet they converge on
impaired intrinsic immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in nasal epithelial
cells. Further, it suggests that there may be a clinical window
in which severe disease can be subverted by focusing preventa-
tive or therapeutic interventions early within the nasopharynx
(Feld et al., 2020; Hoagland et al., 2021; Monk et al., 2021;
Wang et al., 2020a), bolstering anti-viral responses and curbing
pathological inﬂammatory signaling prior to development of se-
vere respiratory dysfunction or systemic disease.
Limitations of the study
A major difﬁculty in understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo
at early, disease-relevant time points lies in limited strategies for
sampling the upper airway cellular makeup. We collected viable
cells using NP swabs—a minimally invasive clinical procedure
that we were able to apply in both an ambulatory setting and
the intensive care unit at the height of the summer 2020
COVID-19 surge in Mississippi. The simplicity of this procedure,
in comparison to BAL or biopsy-based measurements, repre-
sents a major advantage. However, our pipeline, as imple-
mented, has key limitations arising from viably freezing the NP
swabs (e.g., cell loss, limited cell recovery). We have conﬁrmed
that freezing cells directly on a NP swab does not induce major
differences in the recovered cell composition of the nasal mu-
cosa among healthy donors, but we cannot exclude alterations
speciﬁc to individuals with COVID-19. Consequently, with limited
cellular capture per swab, we potentially under-sample features
of the nasal epithelium, which impacts our ability to detect and
compare low-abundance cell subtypes—such as rare immune
cells with <0.5% frequency in the nasal epithelium (e.g., mast
cells, plasmacytoid DCs). Further, though we are able to recover
SARS-CoV-2 aligning reads in more than 80% of COVID-19 par-
ticipants, we recovered few cells per participant that can be as-
signed as ‘‘SARS-CoV-2 RNA’’ with high conﬁdence. Accord-
ingly, we detect remarkably high heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-
2-targeted cell subtypes across individuals, which may be due
to incomplete recovery of the full distribution of SARS-CoV-2-
targeted cells in any single donor. Finally, our data represent
the population served by the University of Mississippi Medical
Center, and further work will be required to understand how
these data relate to the general population. Multiple cohorts
replicated by distinct research groups across clinical centers
and patient populations will be critical to understand the gener-
alizability of our ﬁndings.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Eligible participants were recruited from outpatient clinics, medical surgical units, intensive care units (ICU), or endoscopy units at the
University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) between April 2020 and September 2020. The UMMC Institutional Review Board
approved the study under IRB#2020-0065. All participants or their legally authorized representative provided written informed con-
sent. Participants were eligible for inclusion in the COVID-19 group if they were at least 18 years old, had a positive nasopharyngeal
swab for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, had COVID-19 related symptoms including fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and sore throat,
and weighed more than 110 lb. Participants were eligible for the Control group if they were at least 18 years old, had a current negative
SARS-CoV-2 test (PCR or rapid antigen test), and weighed more than 110 lb. Participants were considered ‘‘Convalescent’’ if they
met the criteria of the Control group, however had previously tested SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and diagnosed with COVID-19, and
their symptoms had subsided for at least 40 days. Convalescent samples were treated as an independent group, and excluded from
comparisons between ‘‘Control’’ and ‘‘COVID-19’’ groups. Exclusion criteria for the cohort included a history of blood transfusion
within 4 weeks and subjects who could not be assigned a deﬁnitive COVID-19 diagnosis from nucleic acid testing. 35 individuals
with COVID-19 were included, both male (n = 19) and female (n = 16). For the Control group, 21 participants were included – 11 iden-
tiﬁed as male, 10 as female. The median age of COVID-19 participants was 55 years old; the median age of Control participants was
62 years old. Among hospitalized COVID-19 participants, the median day NP swabs were collected was hospital day 2 (inter-quartile

range: 1, range 1-9). COVID-19 participants were classiﬁed according to the 8-level ordinal scale proposed by the WHO representing
their peak clinical severity and level of respiratory support required (World Health Organization, 2020) (Table 1, Figures S1A–S1E).
Notably, for many participants the peak severity differed from their clinical severity score on the day of nasopharyngeal swab (Figures
S1F, S1G). We conﬁrmed that basic health and demographic information including: age, sex, BMI, race/ethnicity, and presence of
co-morbidities was balanced across disease groups (assessed using Chi-square test for categorial variables and Kruskal-Wallis test
for continuous metrics, all comparisons non-signiﬁcant, p > 0.05, Figures S1C–S1E, S7C, Table 1). We additionally performed a cor-
relation analysis among each of our clinical features to understand the relationships among distinct clinical pictures (e.g., severity
score), laboratory ﬁndings (e.g., CRP), and demographic information (e.g., age), and how these relate to our major ﬁndings (e.g.,
secretory cell proportion, viral load, ISG induction, Figure S7C).
METHOD DETAILS
Sample Collection and Biobanking
Nasopharyngeal samples were collected by a trained healthcare provider using FLOQSwabs (Copan ﬂocked swabs) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Collectors would don personal protective equipment (PPE), including a gown, non-sterile gloves, a pro-
tective N95 mask, a bouffant, and a face shield. The patient’s head was tilted back slightly, and the swab inserted along the nasal
septum, above the ﬂoor of the nasal passage to the nasopharynx until slight resistance was felt. The swab was then left in place
for several seconds to absorb secretions and slowly removed while rotating swab. The swab was then placed into a cryogenic
vial with 900 mL of heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Vials were placed into a
Mr. Frosty Freezing Container (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) for optimal cell preservation. A Mr. Frosty containing the vials was placed
in a cooler with dry ice for transportation from patient areas to the laboratory for processing. Once in the laboratory, the Mr. Frosty
was placed into a 80C freezer overnight, and on the next day, the vials were moved to liquid nitrogen storage containers.
Dissociation and Collection of Viable Single Cells from Nasopharyngeal Swabs
Swabs in freezing media (90% FBS/10% DMSO) were stored in liquid nitrogen until immediately prior to dissociation. A detailed sam-
ple protocol can be found here: https://protocols.io/view/human-nasopharyngeal-swab-processing-for-viable-si-bjhkkj4w.html.
(Tang et al., 2020). This approach (Figure S1I) ensures that all cells and cellular material from the nasal swab (whether directly
attached to the nasal swab, or released during the washing and digestion process), are exposed ﬁrst to DTT for 15 min, followed
by an Accutase digestion for 30 min. Brieﬂy, nasal swabs in freezing media were thawed, and each swab was rinsed in RPMI before
incubation in 1 mL RPMI/10 mM DTT (Sigma) for 15 min at 37C with agitation. Next, the nasal swab was incubated in 1 mL Accutase
(Sigma) for 30 min at 37C with agitation. The 1 mL RPMI/10 mM DTT from the nasal swab incubation was centrifuged at 400 g for
5 min at 4C to pellet cells, the supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL Accutase and incubated for
30 min at 37C with agitation. The original cryovial containing the freezing media and the original swab washings were combined and
centrifuged at 400 g for 5 min at 4C. The cell pellet was then resuspended in RPMI/10 mM DTT, and incubated for 15 min at 37C with
agitation, centrifuged as above, the supernatant was aspirated, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL Accutase, and incubated
for 30 min at 37C with agitation. All cells were combined following Accutase digestion and ﬁltered using a 70 mm nylon strainer. The
ﬁlter and swab were washed with RPMI/10% FBS/4 mM EDTA, and all washings combined. Dissociated, ﬁltered cells were centri-
fuged at 400 g for 10 min at 4C, and resuspended in 200 mL RPMI/10% FBS for counting. Cells were diluted to 20,000 cells in 200 mL
for scRNA-seq. For the majority of swabs, fewer than 20,000 cells total were recovered. In these instances, all cells were input into
scRNA-seq.
We directly tested whether cell types collected from NP swabs following cryopreservation were representative of the cellular
composition extracted from a freshly-swabbed nasopharyngeal epithelium, or if certain cell types were lost during freezing (Fig-
ure S2B-S2G). Recovery of viable cells, technical metrics of single-cell library quality, and cellular proportions after clustering and
analysis were all largely stable between matched fresh and cryopreserved swabs taken from the same individual. Importantly, no
‘‘new’’ cell types (from healthy participants) were recovered from the freshly processed samples.
Flow Cytometry of Cells Isolated from Nasopharyngeal Swabs
Single-cell suspensions were isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs of healthy donors, as described above. Cells were ﬁrst stained
with Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) for 15 min to assess viability. Cells were washed with staining buffer
(PBS/2% FBS), and then treated with Human TruStain FcX (Fc receptor blocking solution, Cat. No. 422302, BioLegend) for 5 min.
For quantiﬁcation of immune cell subtypes: cells were stained with a surface marker antibody cocktail on ice for 15 min, which con-
tained PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated anti-human CD45 (clone: HI30, BioLegend), Brilliant Violet 711-conjugated anti-human CD3 (clone:

were ﬁxed using BD Fixation Buffer (Cat. No. 554655, BD Biosciences). AbC Total Antibody Compensation Beads (Cat. No.
A10497, Life Technologies) and ArC Amine Reactive Compensation Beads (Cat. No. A10346, Life Technologies) were used for
compensation. Data were acquired on an LSRFortessa ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using BD FACSDiva software, and analyzed
by FlowJo software (Version 10.7.1, Tree Star Inc.).
Detection of Autoantibodies Binding Human Interferons
Plasma from a subset of 25 participants (5 healthy controls, 12 mild/moderate COVID-19, 8 severe COVID-19) was collected on the
same day as nasopharyngeal swab. Autoantibodies were assessed using a commercial microarray-based platform (GeneCopoeia).
Brieﬂy, participant plasma was hybridized to distinct microarray spots containing 120 native human and viral antigens spotted onto
nitrocellulose ﬁbers (adhered to glass slides). Next, the slides were incubated with ﬂuorescently-coupled anti-IgG or anti-IgM sec-
ondary antibodies, and microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4400A microarray scanner. Raw ﬂuorescence data was normal-
ized to PBS controls on each slide.
Single Cell RNA-Sequencing
Seq-Well S3 was run as previously described (Aicher et al., 2019; Gierahn et al., 2017; Hughes et al., 2019). Brieﬂy, a maximum of
20,000 single cells were deposited onto Seq-Well arrays preloaded with a single barcoded mRNA capture bead (ChemGenes)
per well (Macosko et al., 2015). cells were allowed to settle by gravity into wells for 10 min, after which the arrays were washed
with PBS and RPMI, and sealed with a semi-permeable membrane for 30 min, and incubated in lysis buffer (5 M guanidinium thio-
cyanate/1 mM EDTA/1% BME/0.5% sarkosyl) for 20 min. Arrays were then incubated in a hybridization buffer (2M NaCl/8% v/v
PEG8000) for 40 min, and then the beads were removed from the arrays and collected in 1.5 mL tubes in wash buffer (2M NaCl/
3 mM MgCl2/20 mM Tris-HCl/8% v/v PEG8000). Beads were resuspended in a reverse transcription master mix, and reverse tran-
scription, exonuclease digestion, second-strand synthesis, and whole transcriptome ampliﬁcation were carried out as previously
described. Libraries were generated using Illumina Nextera XT Library Prep Kits and sequenced on NextSeq 500/550 High Output
75 cycle v2.5 kits to an average depth of 180 million aligned reads per array: read 1: 21 (cell barcode, UMI), read 2: 50 (digital gene
expression), index 1: 8 (N700 barcode).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data Preprocessing and Quality Control
Pooled libraries were demultiplexed using bcl2fastq (v2.17.1.14) with default settings (mask_short_adapter_reads 10, minimum_-
trimmed_read_length 10, implemented using Cumulus, snapshot 4, https://cumulus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/bcl2fastq.html) (Li
et al., 2020). Libraries were aligned using STAR within the Drop-Seq Computational Protocol (https://github.com/broadinstitute/
Drop-seq) and implemented on Cumulus (https://cumulus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/drop_seq.html, snapshot 9, default parameters)
(Macosko et al., 2015). A custom reference was created by combining human GRCh38 (from CellRanger version 3.0.0, Ensembl 93)
and SARS-CoV-2 RNA genomes. The SARS-CoV-2 viral sequence and GTF are as described in Kim et al., 2020 (https://github.com/
hyeshik/sars-cov-2-transcriptome, BetaCov/South Korea/KCDC03/2020 based on NC_045512.2) (Kim et al., 2020). The GTF in-
cludes all CDS regions (as of this annotation of the transcriptome, the CDS regions completely cover the RNA genome without over-
lapping segments), and regions were added to describe the 50 UTR (‘‘SARSCoV2_5prime’’), the 30 UTR (‘‘SARSCoV2_3prime’’), and
reads aligning to anywhere within the Negative Strand (‘‘SARSCoV2_NegStrand’’). Trailing A’s at the 30 end of the virus were excluded
from the SARS-CoV-2 FASTA, as these were found to drive spurious viral alignment in pre-COVID19 samples. Finally, additional small
sequences were appended to the FASTA and GTF that differentiate reads that align to the 70-nucleotide region around the viral TRS
sequence – either across the intact, unspliced genomic sequences (e.g., named ‘‘SARSCoV2_Unspliced_S’’ or ‘‘SARSCoV2_Uns-
pliced_Leader’’) or various spliced RNA species (e.g., ‘‘SARSCoV2_Spliced_Leader_TRS_S’’), see schematics in Figures 4F, 4G, Fig-
ures S6A. Alignment references were tested against a diverse set of pre-COVID-19 samples and in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected human
bronchial epithelial cultures (Ravindra et al., 2020) to conﬁrm speciﬁcity of viral aligning reads. Aligned cell-by-gene matrices were
merged across all study participants, and cells were ﬁltered to eliminate barcodes with fewer than 200 UMI, 150 unique genes, and
greater than 50% mitochondrial reads. Swabs from 58 individuals are included in the study. Three additional swabs were thawed and
processed but contained no high-quality cell barcodes after sequencing (NB: these samples contained < 5,000 viable cells prior to
Seq-Well array loading).This resulted in a ﬁnal dataset of 32,871 genes and 32,588 cells across 58 study participants (35 SARS-CoV-
2+, 23 SARS-CoV-2-). Preprocessing, alignment, and data ﬁltering was applied equivalently to samples from the fresh versus frozen
cohort. For analysis of RNA velocity, we also recovered both exonic and intronic alignment information using DropEst (Cumulus

Cell Clustering and Annotation
Dimensionality reduction, cell clustering, and differential gene analysis were all achieved using the Seurat (v3.1.5) package in R pro-
gramming language (v3.0.2) (Stuart et al., 2019). Dimensionality reduction was carried out by running principal components analysis
(PCA) over the 3,483 most variable genes with dispersion > 0.8 (tested over a range of dispersion > 0.7 to dispersion > 1.2; dispersion
> 0.8 was determined as optimal based on number of variable genes, and general stability of clustering results across these cutoffs
was conﬁrmed). Only variable genes from human transcripts were considered for dimensionality reduction and clustering. Using the
Jackstraw function within Seurat, we selected the ﬁrst 36 principal components that described the majority of variance within the
dataset, and used these for deﬁning a nearest neighbor graph and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) plot. Cells
were clustered using Louvain clustering, and the resolution parameter was chosen by maximizing the average silhouette score
across all clusters. Differentially expressed genes between each cluster and all other cells were calculated using a likelihood ratio
test, implemented with Seurat’s FindAllMarkers function, test.use set to ‘‘bimod’’ (McDavid et al., 2013). Clusters were merged if
they failed to contain > 25 signiﬁcantly differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.001). We proceeded iteratively through each cluster
and subcluster until ‘‘terminal’’ cell subsets/cell states were identiﬁed – we deﬁned ‘‘terminal’’ cell states when PCA and Louvain clus-
tering did not conﬁdently identify additional sub-states, as measured by abundance of differentially expressed genes between po-
tential clusters (often > 25 cluster-speciﬁc marker genes with FDR < 0.001). Among two samples, we recovered erythroblast-like
cells, deﬁned by expression of hemoglobin subunits including HBB and HBA2 (these were from swabs noted to be slightly red-tinged
on day of processing). For visualization in Figure 2, we pooled all cells determined to be of epithelial origin from coarse-grained anno-
tation (ciliated cells, secretory cells, goblet cells, basal cells, mitotic basal cells, developing secretory and goblet cells, developing
ciliated cells, squamous cells, deuterosomal cells, and ionocytes) and used the methods for dimensionality reduction as above
(dispersion cutoff > 1, 30 principal components). We applied similar approaches for immune cell types (Figure S3), including iterative
subclustering to resolve and annotate all constituent cells types and subtypes. Gene module scores were calculated using the Add-
ModuleScore function within Seurat.
Seven major epithelial types were recovered from this dataset, annotated according to prior knowledge of the composition and
developmental relationships between cells of the upper airway and nasal mucosa (Deprez et al., 2020; Rao Tata and Rajagopal,
2017). Basal cells represent the main stem/progenitor cells of the nasal epithelium, and are classically deﬁned by TP63, KRT5,
and KRT15 expression (Rock et al., 2009). Goblet cells generate the contents of mucus via secretion of mucin proteins (e.g., MU-
C5AC, MUC5B), which play a critical role in lubricating the respiratory epithelium and trapping inhaled particles and pathogens.
Secretory cells are a distinct exocrine cell of the nasal epithelium, and are distinguished from goblet cells by the absence of mucin
production and preferential expression of antimicrobial molecules (e.g., BPIFA1) (Bingle and Craven, 2002). We designated a small
population of cells ‘‘developing secretory and goblet cells’’ based on their lower expression of classic secretory/goblet cell genes, as
well as persistent expression of some basal cell markers (e.g., persistent COL7A1 and DST expression, but diminishing KRT5, KRT15
expression). A specialized subtype of secretory/club cell, ionocytes, were recently discovered in lung tissue, and regulate mucus vis-
cosity and are the major expressors of CFTR (mutations in the CFTR gene underlie the disease cystic ﬁbrosis) (Montoro et al., 2018;
Plasschaert et al., 2018). Ciliated cells are the most numerous cell type of the upper respiratory epithelium, whose hair-like cilia move
mucus and debris out of the respiratory tract. Deuterosomal cells are another recently discovered respiratory cell type, and are hy-
pothesized to represent an intermediate cell state as secretory/goblet cells trans-differentiate into ciliated cells. Deuterosomes are
cellular structures that produce the numerous centrioles required to nucleate multi-ciliated structures on ciliated cells; the genes to
produce deuterosomes are upregulated within deuterosomal cells, such as DEUP1 and CCNO (Garcıa´ et al., 2019; Revinski et al.,
2018). Finally, squamous cells of the nasopharyngeal mucosa are ﬂat cells that form barrier structures of the oropharyngeal and ante-
rior nasal mucosa.
Among some cell types, we did not ﬁnd additional within-type diversity, and thus the ‘‘coarse’’ annotations (Figure 2A) are equiv-
alent to the ‘‘detailed’’ identities (Figure 2D). We annotated epithelial subtypes according to the following groups and representative
markers: goblet cells were split into 4 distinct sets: MUC5AChigh goblet cells, which lacked additional specialized markers beyond
classic goblet cell identiﬁers, SCGB1A1high goblet cells, AZGP1high goblet cells, and AZGP1highSCGB3A1highLTFhigh goblet cells.
Secretory cells were divided into 6 distinct detailed subtypes: SERPINB11high secretory cells (which, similar to MUC5AChigh goblet
cells, represented a more ‘‘generic’’ or un-differentiated secretory cell phenotype), BPIFA1high secretory cells, early response secre-
tory cells (which expressed genes such as JUN, EGR1, FOS, NR4A1), KRT24highKRT13high secretory cells (which are similar to pre-
viously-described KRT13+ ‘‘hillock’’ cells (Deprez et al., 2020; Montoro et al., 2018)), BPIFA1highchemokinehigh secretory cells (che-
mokines include CXCL8, CXCL2, CXCL1, and CXCL3), and interferon responsive secretory cells (deﬁned by higher expression of
broad anti-viral genes including IFITM3, IFI6, and MX1). Subsets of squamous cells were also found – detailed squamous cell sub-
types include CCL5high squamous cells, VEGFAhigh squamous cells (which express multiple vascular endothelial genes including
VEGFA and VWF), SPRR2Dhigh squamous cells (which, in addition to SPRR2D, express the highest abundances of multiple
SPRR- genes including SPRR2A, SPRR1B, SPRR2E, and SPRR3), and HOPXhigh squamous cells. Finally, ciliated cells could be
further divided into 5 distinct subtypes: interferon responsive ciliated cells (expressing anti-viral genes similar to other ‘‘interferon
responsive’’ subsets, such as IFIT1, IFIT3, IFI6), FOXJ1high ciliated cells, early response FOXJ1high ciliated cells (which, in addition
to high FOXJ1, also express higher abundances of genes such as JUN, EGR1, FOS than other ciliated cell subtypes), ciliahigh ciliated
cells (which broadly express the highest abundances of structural cilia genes, such as DLEC1 and CFAP100), and BEST4highciliahigh
ciliated cells (in addition to cilia components, also express the ion channel BEST4). We also recovered a very small population of cells

we term ‘‘enteroendocrine cells,’’ based on unique expression of gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), which is typically produced by
intestinal and gastric enteroendocrine cells and LGR5, which classically marks stem cell populations in the gastrointestinal mucosa
(Basak et al., 2017). Consistent with the use of nasal swabs for cell collection, we did not recover stromal cell populations such as
endothelial cells, ﬁbroblasts, or pericytes (Deprez et al., 2020; Garcıa´ et al., 2019; Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2018).
We similarly analyzed immune cell types for additional diversity. Among macrophages (coarse annotation), we resolved 5 distinct
subtypes (Figure S3B). FFAR4high macrophages are deﬁned by expression of FFAR4, MRC1, CHIT1, and SIGLEC11, as well as
chemotactic factors including CCL18, CCL15, genes involved in leukotriene synthesis (ALOX5, ALOX5AP, LTA4H), and toll-like re-
ceptors TLR8 and TLR2 (Figure S3F, full differentiating gene lists for immune subtypes found in Table S1). Interferon responsive mac-
rophages are distinguished by elevated expression of anti-viral genes such as IFIT3, IFIT2, ISG15, and MX1, akin to the epithelial
subsets labeled ‘‘interferon responsive,’’ along with CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, which are likely indicative of IFNg stimulation.
MSR1highC1QBhigh macrophages are deﬁned by cathepsin expression (CTSD, CTSL, CTSB) and elevated expression of complement
(C1QB, C1QA, C1QC), and lipid binding proteins (APOE, APOC, and NPC2). The fourth ‘‘specialized’’ subtype of macrophage we
term ‘‘inﬂammatory macrophages,’’ which uniquely express inﬂammatory cytokines such as CCL3, CCL3L1, IL1B, CXCL2, and
CXCL3. The remaining ‘‘ITGAXhigh’’ macrophages are distinguished from other immune cell types by ITGAX, VCAN, PSAP, FTL,
FTH1 and CD163 (though these genes are shared by other specialized macrophages subsets). T cells are largely CD69 and
CD8A positive, with signiﬁcantly-enriched expression of ITGAE, ITGB7 and CD44, consistent with a T resident memory-like pheno-
type (Cosgrove et al., 2021), and we are not able to resolve a separate cluster of CD4 T cells (Table S1). Two specialized subtypes of
CD8 T cells are annotated from this dataset: one deﬁned by exceptionally high expression of early response genes (FOSB, NR4A2,
and CCL5), and the other termed ‘‘interferon responsive cytotoxic CD8 T cells,’’ deﬁned by granzyme and perforin expression
(GZMB, GZMA, GNLY, PRF1, GZMH), anti-viral genes (ISG20, IFIT3, APOBEC3C, GBP5) and genes associated with effector CD8
T cell function (LAG3, IL2RB, IKZF3, TBX21). Multiple cell types could not be further subdivided from their coarse annotation (Fig-
ure 1B, Figure S3A-S3E), including mast cells, plasmacytoid DCs, B cells, and dendritic cells.
RNA Velocity and Pseudotemporal Ordering of Epithelial Cells
RNA velocity was modeled using the scVelo package, version 0.2.3 (Bergen et al., 2020; La Manno et al., 2018). Brieﬂy, RNA velocity
analysis leverages the dynamic relationships between expression of unspliced (intron-containing) and spliced (exonic) RNA across
thousands of variable genes, enabling 1) estimation of the directionality of transitions between distinct cells and cell types, and 2)
identiﬁcation of putative driver genes behind these transitions. Using cluster annotations previously assigned from iterative clustering
in Seurat, cells from epithelial cell types were pre-processed according to the scVelo pipeline: genes were normalized using default
parameters (pp.ﬁlter_and_normalize), principal components and nearest neighbors in PCA space were calculated (using defaults of
30 PCs, 30 nearest neighbors), and the ﬁrst and second order moments of nearest neighbors were computed, which are used as
inputs into velocity estimates (pp.moments). RNA velocity was estimated using the scVelo tool tl.recover_dynamics with default input
parameters, which maps the full splicing kinetics for all genes and tl.velocity, with mode = ’dynamical’. Top velocity transition ‘‘driver’’
genes were identiﬁed by high ‘‘ﬁt_likelihood’’ parameters from the dynamical model, and are used for visualization in Figure S2L. The
same approaches were used for modeling RNA velocity among only basal, secretory, and goblet cells (Figures 2F–2I), only ciliated
cells (Figures 2K–2N), and only COVID-19 or only Control cells (Figures 2P, 2Q). For RNA velocity analysis of ciliated cells or basal,
secretory and goblet cells, the velocity pseudotime was calculated using the tl.velocity_pseudotime function with default settings.
Metatranscriptomic Classiﬁcation of Reads from Single-Cell RNA-Seq
ScRNA-seq protocols utilize poly-adenylated RNA capture and reverse transcription to generate snapshots of the transcriptional sta-
tus of each individual cell. As several pathogens and commensal microbes also utilize poly-adenylation for RNA intermediates, or
contain poly-adenylated stretches of RNA within their genomes, they may also be represented within scRNA-seq libraries. To identify
co-detected microbial taxa present in the cell-associated or ambient RNA of nasopharyngeal swabs, we used the Kraken2 software
implemented using the Broad Institute viral-ngs pipelines on Terra (https://github.com/broadinstitute/viral-pipelines/tree/master)
(Wood et al., 2019). A previously-published reference database included human, archaea, bacteria, plasmid, viral, fungi, and proto-
zoa species and was constructed on May 5, 2020, therefore included sequences belonging to the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus (Lemieux
et al., 2021). Inputs to Kraken2 were: kraken2_db_tgz = ’’gs://pathogen-public-dbs/v1/kraken2-broad-20200505.tar.zst,’’ krona_-
taxonomy_db_kraken2_tgz = ’’gs://pathogen-public-dbs/v1/krona.taxonomy-20200505.tab.zst,’’ ncbi_taxdump_tgz = ’’gs://path-
ogen-public-dbs/v1/taxdump-20200505.tar.gz,’’ trim_clip_db = ’’gs://pathogen-public-dbs/v0/contaminants.clip_db.fasta’’ and
spikein_db = ’’gs://pathogen-public-dbs/v0/ERCC_96_nopolyA.fasta.’’ Viral species with fewer than 5 reads were considered
spurious and excluded. Swabs from two individuals contain rare reads classiﬁed as Inﬂuenza A virus species, and we observe no
evidence for other seasonal human coronaviruses, Inﬂuenza B virus, metapneumovirus, or orthopneumovirus. Swabs from two in-
dividuals with mild/moderate COVID-19 contain exceptionally high abundances of reads classiﬁed as Rhinovirus A (2.1e5 and 2.4e5
reads) (Figure 4A).
Correction for Ambient Viral RNA and Deﬁning High-Conﬁdence SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ Cells
Data from high-throughput scRNA-seq platforms frequently experience low-levels of non-speciﬁc RNA assigned to cell barcodes
that does not represent true cell-derived transcriptomic material, but rather contamination from the ambient pool of RNA. To safe-

guard against spurious assignment of SARS-CoV-2 RNA to cells without true intracellular viral material, i.e., viral RNA non-speciﬁcally
picked up from the microenvironment as a component of ambient RNA contamination, we employed the following corrections and
statistical tests to control for ambient viral RNA and enable conﬁdent assignments for SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells. Similar to ap-
proaches previously described, we tested whether the abundance of viral RNA within a given single cell was signiﬁcantly higher
than expected by chance given the estimate of ambient RNA contaminating that cell, as well as the proportion of viral RNA of the
total ambient RNA pool (Cao et al., 2020; Delorey et al., 2021; Fleming et al., 2019; Kotliar et al., 2020). First, this required modeling
and estimating the ambient RNA fraction associated with each individual swab. Here, we employed CellBender (https://github.com/
broadinstitute/CellBender), a software package built to learn the ambient RNA proﬁle per sample and provide an ambient RNA-cor-
rected output (Fleming et al., 2019). Input UMI count matrices contained the top 10,000 cell barcodes, therefore including at least
70% cell barcodes sampling the ambient RNA and low-complexity cell barcodes. CellBender’s remove-background function was
run with default parameters and–fpr 0.01–expected-cells 500–low-count-threshold 5. Using the corrected output from each sample’s
count matrix following CellBender, we calculated the proportion of ambient contamination per high-quality cell by comparing to the
single-cell’s transcriptome pre-correction, and summed all UMI from background cell barcodes to recover an estimate of the total
ambient pool. Next, we tested whether the abundance of viral RNA in a given single cell was signiﬁcantly above the null abundance
given the ambient RNA characteristics using an exact binomial test (implemented in R: binom.test):
P x
ð Þ =
n!
n  x

P values were FDR-corrected within sample, and cells whose SARS-CoV-2 UMI abundance with FDR < 0.01 were considered
‘‘SARS-CoV-2 RNA+.’’
During SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral uncoating from endosomal vesicles releases the positive, single-stranded, 50 capped, poly-ad-
enylated genome into the host cytosol (Figures 4F, 4G). Here, translation of non-structural proteins proceeds ﬁrst by templating
directly off of the viral genome, generating a replication and transcription complex. The viral replication complex then produces
both 1) negative strand genomic RNA intermediates, which serve as templates for further positive strand genomic RNA and 2) nested
subgenomic mRNAs which are constructed from a 50 leader sequence fused to a 30 sequence encoding structural proteins for pro-
duction of viral progeny (e.g., Spike, Envelope, Membrane, Nucleocapsid). Generation of nested subgenomic mRNAs relies on
discontinuous transcription occurring between pairs of 6-mer transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS), one 30 to the leader
sequence (termed leader TRS, or TRS-L), and others 50 to each gene coding sequence (termed body TRS, or TRS-B) (Sawicki
et al., 2007). We reasoned that SARS-CoV-2 aligning UMI could be readily distinguished by their strandedness (aligning to the nega-
tive versus positive strand) and whether they fell within coding regions, across intact TRS (indicating RNA splicing had not occurred
for that RNA molecule at that splice site) or across a TRS with leader-to-body fusions (corresponding to subgenomic RNA, Figure 4F,
4G, Figure S6A). Notably, single cells containing reads aligning to spliced (subgenomic) RNA are heavily skewed toward those cells
that contain the highest overall abundances of viral UMI – this may be an accurate reﬂection of coronavirus biology, wherein subge-
nomic RNA are most frequent within cells robustly producing new virions and total viral genomic material, but also points to inherent
limitations in the detection of low-frequency RNA species by single-cell RNA-seq technologies.
Differential Expression by Group, Cell Type, or Viral RNA Status
To compare gene expression between cells from distinct disease groups we employed a likelihood ratio test assuming a negative
binomial distribution. Cells from each cell type belonging to either COVID-19 WHO 1-5 (mild/moderate), COVID-19 WHO 6-8 (severe),
or Control WHO 0 were compared in a pairwise manner, implemented using the Seurat FindAllMarkers function (test.use = ‘‘negbi-
nom’’). We considered genes as differentially expressed with an FDR-adjusted p value < 0.001 and log fold change > 0.25. To
compare gene expression between SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells and bystander cells (from COVID-19 participants, but without intracel-
lular viral RNA) we used a negative binomial generalized linear model implemented using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014). Here, we em-
ployed the following criteria for SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ versus bystander testing: 1) we only tested cell types containing at least 15 SARS-
CoV-2 RNA+ cells, 2) for each cell type, we restricted our bystander cells to the same participants as the SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells, 3)
in comparisons where bystander cells were substantially more numerous than SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells, we randomly sub-sampled
the bystander cells to at most 4x the number of SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells, and 4) we ensured that the sampled bystander cells for
comparison matched the cell quality distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells, based on binned deciles of UMI/cell. DESeq2
was run with default parameters and test = ‘‘Wald.’’ Gene ontology analysis was run using the Database for Annotation, Visualization,
and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (Huang et al., 2009). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was completed using the R package
fgsea over genes ranked by average log foldchange expression between each group, including all genes with an average expression
> 0.5 UMI within each respective cell type (Korotkevich et al., 2021). Gene lists corresponding to ‘‘Shared IFN Response,’’ ‘‘Type I IFN
Speciﬁc Response’’ and ‘‘Type II IFN Speciﬁc Response’’ are derived from previously-published population RNA-seq data from nasal
epithelial basal cells treated in vitro with 0.1 ng/mL – 10 ng/mL IFNa or IFNg for 12 h (Ziegler et al., 2020). Module scores were calcu-
lated using the Seurat function AddModuleScore with default inputs.

Statistical Testing
All statistical tests were implemented either in R (v4.0.2) or Prism (v6) software (R Core Team, 2019). Comparisons between cell type
proportions by disease group were tested using a Kruskal-Wallis test with FDR correction across all cell types, implemented in R
using the kruskal.test, and p.adjust functions. Post-tests for between-group pairwise comparisons used Dunn’s test. Spearman cor-
relation was used where appropriate, implemented using the cor.test function in R. All testing for differential expression was imple-
mented in R using either Seurat, scVelo, or DESeq2, and all results were FDR-corrected as noted in speciﬁc STAR Methods sections.
P values, n, and all summary statistics are provided either in the results section, ﬁgure legends, ﬁgure panels, or supplementary ta-
bles. Prism (v6), R (v4.0.2) packages ggplot2 (v3.3.2 (Wickham, 2016)), Seurat (v3.2.2 (Butler et al., 2018)), ComplexHeatmap (v2.7.3
(Gu et al., 2016)), Circlize (0.4.11 (Gu et al., 2014)), fgsea (v.1.16.0 (Korotkevich et al., 2021)), DESeq2 (v1.30.0 (Love et al., 2014)), and
Python (v3.8.3) package scVelo (v0.3.0 (Bergen et al., 2020)) were used for visualization.
